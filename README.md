This is a repository for working through the book Build Your Own Lisp @ https://buildyourownlisp.com

I am using the C programming language with VIM on Ubuntu (WSL) to learn multiple things while working through this project.

I am also using git on the command line for the first time to have version control on my source files. 

Thanks for checking this out.
